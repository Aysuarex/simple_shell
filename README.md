# simple_shell
 A simple UNIX command interpreter making as a final project of the low-level programming and algorithm quarter at ALX school of software engineering

## Overview
Sodashy is a sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file.

## Invocation
Usage: Sodash Sodash is started with the standard input connected to the terminal. To start, compile all .c located in this repository by using this command:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o sodash
./sodash
Sodash is allowed to be invoked interactively and non-interactively. If sodash is invoked with standard input not connected to a terminal, it reads and executes received commands in order.

## Example:

$ echo "echo 'holberton'" | ./sodash
'holberton'
$
When sodash is invoked with standard input connected to a terminal (determined by isatty(3), the interactive mode is opened. sodash Will be using the following prompt ^-^ .

## Example:

$./sodash
^-^
If a command line argument is invoked, sodash will take that first argument as a file from which to read commands.

## Example:

$ cat text
echo 'ALX'
$ ./sodash text
'ALX'
$
## Environment
Upon invocation, sodash receives and copies the environment of the parent process in which it was executed. This environment is an array of name-value strings describing variables in the format NAME=VALUE. A few key environmental variables are:

## HOME
The home directory of the current user and the default directory argument for the cd builtin command.

$ echo "echo $HOME" | ./sodash
/home/vagrant
## PWD
The current working directory as set by the cd command.

$ echo "echo $PWD" | ./sodash
/home/vagrant/holberton/simple_shell
## OLDPWD
The previous working directory as set by the cd command.

$ echo "echo $OLDPWD" | ./sodash
/home/vagrant/holberton/bog-062019-test_suite
## PATH
A colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for commands. A null directory name in the path (represented by any of two adjacent colons, an initial colon, or a trailing colon) indicates the current directory.

$ echo "echo $PATH" | ./sodash
/home/vagrant/.cargo/bin:/home/vagrant/.local/bin:/home/vagrant/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build/bin:/home/vagrant/.rbenv/shims:/home/vagrant/.rbenv/bin:/home/vagrant/.nvm/versions/node/v10.15.3/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin:/home/vagrant/.cargo/bin:/home/vagrant/workflow:/home/vagrant/.local/bin
## Command Execution
After receiving a command, sodash tokenizes it into words using " " as a delimiter. The first word is considered the command and all remaining words are considered arguments to that command. sodash then proceeds with the following actions:

If the first character of the command is neither a slash (\) nor dot (.), the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins. If there exists a builtin by that name, the builtin is invoked.
If the first character of the command is none of a slash (\), dot (.), nor builtin, sodash searches each element of the PATH environmental variable for a directory containing an executable file by that name.
If the first character of the command is a slash (\) or dot (.) or either of the above searches was successful, the shell executes the named program with any remaining given arguments in a separate execution environment.
## Exit Status
sodash returns the exit status of the last command executed, with zero indicating success and non-zero indicating failure. If a command is not found, the return status is 127; if a command is found but is not executable, the return status is 126. All builtins return zero on success and one or two on incorrect usage (indicated by a corresponding error message).

## Signals
While running in interactive mode, sodash ignores the keyboard input ctrl+c. Alternatively, an input of End-Of-File ctrl+d will exit the program.

User hits ctrl+d in the foutrh command.

$ ./sodash
^-^ ^C
^-^ ^C
^-^ ^C
^-^
## Variable Replacement
sodash interprets the $ character for variable replacement.

## $ENV_VARIABLE
ENV_VARIABLE is substituted with its value.

Example:

$ echo "echo $PWD" | ./sodash
/home/vagrant/holberton/simple_shell
## $?
? is substitued with the return value of the last program executed.

Example:

$ echo "echo $?" | ./sodash
0
$$
The second $ is substitued with the current process ID.

Example:

$ echo "echo $$" | ./sodash
3855
## Comments
sodash ignores all words and characters preceeded by a # character on a line.

Example:

$ echo "echo 'alx' #this will be ignored!" | ./sodash
'alx'
## Operators
sodash specially interprets the following operator characters:

; - Command separator
Commands separated by a ; are executed sequentially.

Example:

$ echo "echo 'hello' ; echo 'world'" | ./sodash
'hello'
'world'
## && - AND logical operator
command1 && command2: command2 is executed if, and only if, command1 returns an exit status of zero.

Example:

$ echo "error! && echo 'holberton'" | ./sodash
./shellby: 1: error!: not found
$ echo "echo 'my name is' && echo 'holberton'" | ./sodash
'my name is'
'holberton'
## || - OR logical operator
command1 || command2: command2 is executed if, and only if, command1 returns a non-zero exit status.

Example:

$ echo "error! || echo 'wait for it'" | ./sodash
./sodash: 1: error!: not found
'wait for it'
The operators && and || have equal precedence, followed by ;.

## Builtin Commands
### cd
Usage: cd [DIRECTORY]
Changes the current directory of the process to DIRECTORY.
If no argument is given, the command is interpreted as cd $HOME.
If the argument - is given, the command is interpreted as cd $OLDPWD and the pathname of the new working directory is printed to standad output.
If the argument, -- is given, the command is interpreted as cd $OLDPWD but the pathname of the new working directory is not printed.
The environment variables PWD and OLDPWD are updated after a change of directory.
Example:

$ ./sodash
^-^ pwd
/home/vagrant/holberton/simple_shell
$ cd ../
^-^ pwd
/home/vagrant/holberton
^-^ cd -
^-^ pwd
/home/vagrant/holberton/simple_shell
## exit
Usage: exit [STATUS]
Exits the shell.
The STATUS argument is the integer used to exit the shell.
If no argument is given, the command is interpreted as exit 0.
Example:

$ ./sodash
$ exit
## env
Usage: env
Prints the current environment.
Example:

$ ./sodash
$ env
NVM_DIR=/home/vagrant/.nvm
...
## setenv
Usage: setenv [VARIABLE] [VALUE]
Initializes a new environment variable, or modifies an existing one.
Upon failure, prints a message to stderr.
Example:

$ ./sodash
$ setenv NAME Alx
$ echo $NAME
Alx
## unsetenv
Usage: unsetenv [VARIABLE]
Removes an environmental variable.
Upon failure, prints a message to stderr.
Example:

$ ./sodash
$ setenv NAME Holberton
$ unsetenv NAME
$ echo $NAME
